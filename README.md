# spotter-admin
Spotter is an app which lets users make walks more interesting by keeping track of the dog breeds they've seen over time. Whilst also being educational!

This repo is very much a WIP but here is our goal...

# Goal

We'd like to be able to keep the database of dog breeds up to date and easy to do by a non technical person.

**MVP** Create a form which when filled in uploads the new dog breed to the database and adds the specified image to the storage.

**Stretch Goal** In an ideal world we could upload a CSV which uses the breed as a unique key to know whether to update the fields of the existing breed or to create a new breed. Minimum user input. Gold. 

# Run it

To run it you'll need to pull the repo and have node installed. If thats true, get the env vars from me, go in to that repo and run:

`npm run watch`

and then go to your localhost and watch it go.
